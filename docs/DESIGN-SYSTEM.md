# Design System

## Context

This project leverage CSS and SCSS variables to define a design system.

## Rules

- SCSS variables for complex and logical operations. They must be private and translated to css variables
- CSS variables are used in Svelte component

Because better readability + single way of using variables (because of the theming)
